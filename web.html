	<p id="wd">ACCORDING TO ME WEB DEVELOPMENT IS A SUBJECT IN WHICH YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS BETTER WHEN YOU PRACTICE MORE ,DO CODING AND USE NEW PROPERTIES OR ATTRIBUTES YOU DON'T KNOW AND LEARN FROM THE PRACTICAL RESULTS.  AND I LIKE THIS SUBJECT BECAUSE IT IS FUN TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A WEBSITE FROM THE IDEAS WE VISUALIZE IN OUR MINDS AND ALSO IT IS VERY INTERESTING AS WE LEARN AND TRY IN PRACTICAL TO MAKE WEBSITE ,AND I TRY TO MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE VERSION EVERY TIME I LEARN SOMETHING NEW. I HOPE THAT AFTER COMPLETION OF THE COURSE I WILL BE ABLE TO DO A INTERNSHIP/JOB IN WEB DEVELOPMENT TO POLISH MY SKILLS AND HAVE A GOOD EXPOSURE IN WEB DEVELOPMENT.  </p>
